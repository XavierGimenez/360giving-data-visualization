360G-Wellcome-208013_Z_17_Z,21st Century Families: Parent-child relationships and children's psychological wellbeing,"New pathways to parenthood have recently emerged that did not exist, nor had even been imagined, at the turn of the 21st century. Individuals who were previously unknown to each other have begun to meet over the internet with the purpose of having children together; transgender men and women have begun to have children through medically assisted reproduction; single heterosexual men have begun to use surrogacy to become single fathers by choice; and women have begun to use identifiable egg donors to have children. These emerging family structures raise new ethical, social and psychological concerns, particularly regarding the potentially negative consequences for children. The proposed research will provide empirical evidence from a multidisciplinary perspective on the social and psychological consequences for children of growing up in family arrangements involving non-cohabiting co-parents, transgender parents, elective single fathers and identifiable egg donors. In this emotive area of family life on which people often hold strong opinions, our aim is to challenge prejudice and assumption with evidence on the actual consequences – good, bad or neutral – for children. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to increase understanding of diversity in family life and improve the lives of 21st century children.

360G-Wellcome-201815_Z_16_Z,FAMILY REHAB,"This 2-part series for BBC2 follows the work of the only family rehab in the UK. Based in Sheffield, Phoenix Futures' National Specialist Family Service is a last chance for parents addicted to drugs and alcohol to kick their habits, change their lives and prove that they can parent their children.
12 families live together in a community that will become their lifeline. They have 6 months to transform. Fail, and their children will be taken from them. They arrive as a family unit; whether they leave as one is up to them.
Every step of the process is uncovered to reveal how this unique rehab works and what that transformation looks like. Uniquely we see this from the children’s perspective as well as the parents. And for most of the families here, that turnaround is dramatic.
 Against the odds, 75% complete the programme and leave with their children.  
After 4 years, 70% of the families are still together, and clean.
This series, explores in depth what it takes to turn addicts into parents and mend families broken by addiction.

The research will trial innovative methods involving twenty-first century technologies, creating computer-based tasks and games with which to access young children's representations. It will also explore the similarities and differences in the thoughts and feelings of young donor-concei ved children in one and two-parent families.

The key goals are to reveal understanding of the motivation of families to seek admission of children to such a residential institution; to examine how the selection process worked; to explore the outcomes for those children who were accepted, notably when they reached the age for discharge; and to consider why certain cases applying for admission were unsuccessful and to trace what happened to some of those rejected children.

360G-Wellcome-201001_Z_16_Z, Bringing eczema to children's picture books,"Eczema affects a fifth of children in developed countries and its prevalence is increasing. Managing eczema takes time and can be stressful for parents and children alike. Picture books are often used to help children understand an issue (the arrival of a new sibling; toilet training, etc). Yet children's bookshops have no picture books about eczema. The commercial emollient companies produce poorly written and illustrated books for children, but these are for the specialist market - and are dedicated to selling a particular product. 
I want to produce a high quality picture book where eczema features in the story. Carers and children with eczema will have an input into the creative process. It will be fun enough to read for pleasure but will also have an educational message that normalises eczema for those who have it, while familiarising others with the condition. It could be used in schools but it would not be didactic. Most importantly, I want the illustrations to be sumptuous: it has to be a book that parents and children have the chance to fall in love with and want to re-visit for its own sake.
