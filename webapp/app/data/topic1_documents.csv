This will allow us to transport equipment and teacher in a low cost, sustainable and environmentally friendly way. Our Music Teacher used to work as a bike mechanic so will be responsible for maintaining and servicing the bike - we plan for this to take place during teenage other activity sessions so that young people can learn about bike maintenance. The Ukuleles will be used to run music sessions for up to 15 young people and give us a stock of 15 Ukuleles to lend to young people on a short term basis once a young person has demonstrated commitment to the project. Alongside sessions for these young people we will also run family sessions (Whole Family Approach) targeting parents and siblings in order to help families engage positively. This would be especially important when working young people on the Autistic spectrum (ASD) We will link with other professionals (Social workers, NEET officers, Ocupational Therapists) in order to allow them supported contact with hard to reach young people where appropriate. We have chosen these instruments as they are very easy to maintain and fix in case of damage. In the initial stages of the project we have identified 3 target groups of young people who are experiencing or are at risk of social exclusion and/or are vulnerable to bullying or exploitation. These groups are Young carers, ASD young people and disabled/disadvantaged young people attending Inclusive Parasol activities. Young people will be initially recruited for the project through Cheney School, Parasol, Woodfarm primary, Bayards Hill Primary and the Carers Trust. We are confident that other organisations will access the provision in future and are particularly keen to extend the offer to younger children and older people (especially those suffering from dementia).

360G-Wellcome-202206_Z_16_Z,Feel Happy 'Issues' Series,"By the end of the Feel Happy Series, 100 transferable and adaptable ‘fixes’, created by young people (short films, posters, websites, apps), will be circulating among stakeholders (health professionals, researchers, policymakers, youth workers and young people), forming the basis of wide engagement on five focus areas of young people’s health. Young people’s (aged 16-25) experiences with health interventions will be valued as important insights into how their health can be better supported and sustained, and as indicators of thus-far neglected areas for research and practice. 
500 stakeholders will have convened at five, health themed ‘Feel Happy’ events, where young people lead a change-oriented discussion agenda, building on their fixes, on patterns of experience - individually unique but widely recognised - and underpinned by robust, stakeholder-wide reflection to ensure sustainability. Change initiatives will be planned or already implemented in the communities and institutions where young people live.
The Feel Happy Series will have provided social capital that forms the basis for ongoing opportunities for collaboration and transformative change.
Young people will feel empowered as valued citizens whose insights count among decision-makers. Experts will recognise and address the power dynamics that currently hinder genuine participation, having put themselves in young people’s shoes and developed long-term dialogues and solutions driven by young people.
Widespread dissemination of the fixes will mean more young people will be seeking help. They will know their experience is shared, that the limited/negative perceptions of their condition are not universal ‘truths’, and that support can deliver understanding and relief.
