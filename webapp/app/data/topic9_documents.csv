This commission emphasizes that inequities in distribution of structural resources and unequal power relations are root causes of health inequities. 
While many countries around the world have achieved unprecedented and remarkable gains in health status, health disparities between different social groups within these countries appear to be pervasive, with the most disadvantaged groups having fewest opportunities for good health. Most investigations in this field have highlighted a need to develop our understanding of the nature of these health disparities and better evaluate their magnitude. They have specifically called for more comprehensive and intersectoral approaches in order to develop future health policies.
The emerging literature on health inequities has identified five major critical theoretical and technical issues in measuring health inequities which should be addressed at this seminar. These are: 1) Measurement of health status, 2) Identification of the social groupings of population for measuring health inequity, 3) Choice between relative versus absolute measurements of health, 4) Identification of the standard against which health differences are measured and 5) the weights of ill health of population groups along the ill health distribution. 
New research in the area will build on the recent engagement of many countries in the Arab region in large-scale data collection activities, such as Demographic and Health surveys (DHS), the Pan Arab Project for Child Development (PAPCHILD), UNICEF's Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) and Pan Arab Project for Family Health (PAPFAM) and World Health Survey (WHS and including the current round supported by the Gulf Co-operation Council), which contributed substantially to the improvement of the regional database on health issues.",2007-10-18T00:00:00+00:00,10000.0,GB-CHC-210183,The Wellcome Trust,0.0378377075091

While Presidents Carter and Clinton, and particularly the First Ladies, Rosalynn Carter and Hillary Clinton, were very serious about healthcare, I will contrast these two Democratic administrations with more piecemeal reforms during three Republican administrations, focusing on Nixon's and Ford's attempts to redress the  cost of President Johnson's landmark healthcare legislation and Reagan's move away from Carter's Mental Health Systems Act of 1980.

Growing evidence for NSHWs? use in mental health care highlights the need to systematically examine their roles. India has pioneered decentralised mental health services since the 1970s but so far has had limited success in increasing coverage. Describing programmatic achievements and failures and understanding roles of NSHWs within mental health care are essential for informing policy makers and for building recommendations on effective implementation and sustainability of scaling up community mental health services in India and other low income countries (LICs). This project systematically reviews LIC mental health initiatives, which has not been done before. It explores the history and development of NSHWs? roles in mental health care provision in India through oral and written historical primary source analysis, describes NSHWs current roles through ethnographic observation and interviews and uses Delphi and workshop methods with key international and Indian stakeholders to examine the acceptability and feasibility of non-specialists? roles to inform the development of policies in LICs.",2009-08-31T00:00:00+00:00,336667.0,GB-CHC-210183,The Wellcome Trust,0.0361205135962

People who are socio-economically disadvantaged are more likely to have a CMD, less likely to have their disorder recognised by the health service and less likely to benefit from treatment. Currently, we know little about how to reduce this mental health inequality. In this fellowship I propose to address this research gap by investigating the impact of interventions on mental health inequalities. First I will synthesise theory and evidence of how social characteristics influence CMD and drive mental health inequalities (Objective 1). After checking these findings in a range of contemporary datasets (Objective 2), I will compile what is known about the effects of health, social or policy interventions on CMD and social characteristics (Objective 3). Using population data from the Humberside, I will use the data compiled under Objectives 1-3 to simulate the effects of different interventions on CMD, social characteristics, and CMD inequalities in disadvantaged groups. The project outputs will include academic papers and conference proceedings, and a predictive toolkit on the mental health and social effects of different interventions.",2016-01-13T00:00:00+00:00,200482.0,GB-CHC-210183,The Wellcome Trust,0.0342930844472

In 2010, one of our young participants was sectioned after having gone missing for three days and found wandering the streets naked.  This profoundly affected our group; as one of them said: He could be any one of us. Despite their direct and indirect contact, societal stigma and lack of knowledge raises questions of:  *Who exper iences mental health issues and why? *How much is known about mental health? *How are mental health issues different in BMER communities? *What happens to the brain of someone with a mental health issue? *How are our opinions coloured by direct experiences, society and cultural portrayal? *What are the similarities between mental health issues and theatrical performance? With this project, Any One Of Us, TSW will engage 35 13-19 year olds to gain a developed understanding of mental healt h through established research, direct experience and personal insight.  The culmination will be a performance and audio CD which brings together text, movement and sound into an interactive format, enabling the audience to experience the world created.

But in Accra (Ghana's capital), health professionals and journalists lack the training and the resources (such as contact information for health professionals or researchers) needed to report on health. We therefore propose the project,"" Building Bridges: The Health Professionals and Journalists MediaResource Project in Accra, Ghana"" as an intervention to promote health reporting in Ghana. There are four main objectives of the project. First, this project will characterize the expectations and experiences of 20 senior editors (journalists) and the project team on health reporting through a one-day seminar. Second, based on the findings of the seminar, a short course would bedesigned for use in a two-day seminar on health reporting for 30 journalists and 30 health professionals (including health researchers). Third, we would select 5 journalists and 5 health professionals and train them as trainers of health reporting. Finally, we would create a database of all the participants of this project so they can communicate effectively and report more health stories. To evaluate the main outcome of this project, all the participants would be followed for six months to determine the effect of the training on their health reporting practices and beliefs. Although the main audiences are journalists and health professionals (including health researchers, this project is likely to promote public engagement in health research as these audiences produce more health stories or programs.

360G-Wellcome-109393_Z_15_Z,Social media and adolescent mental health: A preliminary qualitative exploration of the potential use of social media for promoting mental health and wellbeing among 12-18 year olds.,"The World Health Organization recognised that there is no health without mental health (WHO, 2005). Despite this, research from many countries has demonstrated that there is a high level of unmet need for mental health (Schomerous & Angermeyer, 2008). This is particularly concerning for children and adolescents. It is well-known that mental health problems increase during mid-to-late adolescence (Burns et al., 2009). While it remains unclear why young people are reluctant to seek help, barriers have included stigma, trust of professionals, and concerns about the characteristics of the provider (Gulliver et al., 2010). In a contemporary digital society it is arguable that social media may be a way of providing information to adolescents and to promote help-seeking behaviour. However, despite the potential, research is only just starting to grapple with the possibilities. It is therefore important that we have a greater understanding of this by exploring adolescents views and engaging me ntal health professionals in the debate. By consulting with these two groups though focus groups and interviews we can gain a better understanding of how adolescents use social media and provide an analysis of the potential benefits and limitations for social media as a mental health promotion tool.",2015-07-20T00:00:00+00:00,4160.0,GB-CHC-210183,The Wellcome Trust,0.0320069559472

1. Enabling health - investigating changing experiences and meanings of health and developing methods for addressing health inequalities; 
2. Health across the life course - studying patterns of emotional well-being and cognitive health in children, families, and older people;

A range of ethical questions and reasonable disagreements have arisen at the level of population health in areas such as priority-setting in health care resource allocation, equity considerations of cost-effective analysis, health measurements, social group health inequalities, global health inequalities, and so forth.  As an alternative to the utilitarian philosophy which  pervades both health care policy and health economics, the proposed research aims to extend the CA to population-level health ethics.  The hypothesis or moral intuition is that the CA can help produce and guide health care policy that does more justice than current health maximization approaches.  The CA is also likely to be more coherent in identifying social action to address population-level bioethical issues outside of health care.  The research seeks to compare and contrast the CA with cost -effective analysis and health maximization; see how the CA would pursue aggregation and efficiency in health policy; see how it would measure health; and see how it would delineate societal versus individual responsibility for health.  The research would be supervised by a international health economist, a social epidemiologist, and a moral and political philosopher.",2010-11-18T00:00:00+00:00,180783.0,GB-CHC-210183,The Wellcome Trust,0.0312275955423

In connection with this I would explore the development of medical care and treatment infrastructure (e.g. doctors and hospitals) in the three presidency towns of Calcutta, Bombay and Madras during this period, noting the shifts and changes. (b) Health of soldiers' wives: The health conditions of lower-class 'barrack wives' such as poor hygiene, alcoholism, lack of maternal care, as well as their impact (eg, high female mortality) in the military barracks. (c) Climate and Clothing: The role of medical handbooks in constructing colonial 'theories' about the impact of tropical climates on white female health as well as the perceived role of exercise and clothing. (d) Tropical Disease: Colonial constructions, such as European women's greater 'vulnerability' to tropical diseases like cholera, malaria, 'enteric fever' and the recommended use of the 'cholera belt' as a prevention.

The term ‘mental health’ was popularised in the early 1900s by physicians and social reformers. Over a century later, mental health and wellbeing in childhood are recurrent themes in the media and on government agendas, with evidence that still more needs to be done on this front. This project has three objectives, namely 1. to analyse conceptual data around mental health in historical children's case files (N=100 from the 30,000 children's case files in the collection); 2. to trace historical, psychological and political developments around 'multi-agency work' and interventions; 3. to compare this with current developments and research regarding mental health in childhood, and my own data from interviews with children in schools, careleavers, professional workers and parents (N=80) to see what lessons can be learnt.",2016-11-15T00:00:00+00:00,3000.0,GB-CHC-210183,The Wellcome Trust,0.0307797817502
