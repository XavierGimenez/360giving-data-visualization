The Nash Ensemble, one of the world's leading chamber music ensembles, will for the first time present its own festival, from 10th-16th August 2009, at the beautiful venue of Cumberland Lodge, Windsor Great Park. The seven day festival will be programmed by Amelia Freedman, founder of the Nash and one of the most distinguished and respected music programmers of the day.  The festival will include works from throughout the chamber music repertoire, from Mozart to Maxwell Davies, and its audiences will be invited to attend concerts, rehearsals, a masterclass and discussions with the players.  
 
This unique festival presents an ideal opportunity to engage the general concert-going public in a series of scientific lectures, demonstrations, workshops and discussions on the topic of The Musical Brain. Performers, festival-residents and concert audiences will be invited to attend presentations given by distinguished neuroscientists actively engaged in research. Neuroscientists will be invited to give accessible introductions to their specific areas of interest (e.g. rhythm, synchronisation, harmony, emotion, rehabilitation) and will have the extraordinary opportunity to work with the Nash Ensemble who can give live demonstrations of their key points. Lectures and workshops will be integrated with, and illustrated by, the music programme.
 
Internationally renowned neuroscientists are greatly interested in taking part in this project, including Prof. Robert Zatorre (University of Montreal), Dr. Stefan Koelsch (Sussex University) and Dr. Jessica Grahn (Cambridge University). Stephen Johnson (musicologist, writer and broadcaster) and Sir Peter Maxwell Davies (Master of the Queen's Music) are also invited to take part
